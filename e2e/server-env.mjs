 * The settings the studio runs with when it is being tested (FB-272).
 *
 * Two things start a studio for testing, and both read this one list so they cannot drift apart:
 *
 *   - Playwright's own server, in `playwright.config.ts` (the UI gate).
 *   - The test copy, `scripts/test-copy.mjs`, which the factory starts for each run. It adds its own
 *     throwaway database (`DATABASE_URL`) and its commit (`BUILD_COMMIT_SHA`) on top of these.
 *
 * Every value here is a test value. Nothing in this file is a real key, a real password or a real
 * founder's data, which is why it is safe in a public repository.
 *
 * Plain JavaScript, not TypeScript, because the test copy is started with plain `node`.
