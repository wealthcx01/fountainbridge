 * The approval card's provenance render (FB-058).
 *
 * This is the only place the sentence "the studio cannot verify this approval" reaches a human, and
 * until this file existed it was deletable without failing a single test — `app/` was outside the
 * unit glob and no e2e touched the card. The most consequential surface in the product was the least

 *
 * The fixtures behind these tests are adversarial on purpose (`_adversarial` in the grant file keeps
 * `make sign-approval-fixtures` from quietly repairing them):
 *   forged-grant      — a grant.json with a bogus attestation, of the kind a lane could write
 *   changed-proposal  — a genuinely studio-signed grant, pinned to a proposal that then changed
