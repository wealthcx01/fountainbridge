/**
 * Releasing a plan the lane stopped to show the founder (FB-122).
 *
 * Before this, nothing anywhere could release a held ticket: the hold marker was written by the lane
 * and no code deleted it. ARCA-054 sat behind that for a week and was eventually done by hand.
 *
 * What is under test is the REFUSALS and their order, which is where the properties live. The write
 * itself is one `putFile`; who is allowed to reach it is the whole question.
