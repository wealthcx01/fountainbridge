 * The planning box's door (FB-275): `POST /api/factory`, signed with `FACTORY_DOOR_SECRET`. Cards,
 * pictures, preview links and heartbeats come in; since FB-276 the box also collects presses here
 * and answers them, because it has no address of its own the studio could call.
 *
 * Outside the sign-in gate (`middleware.ts`), because the box has no session. So this is a public
 * address, and `handleDoor` (lib/factory-door.ts) checks the signature before it reads anything the
 * request says. The format is in `docs/factory-cards.md`.
 *
 * Until `FACTORY_DOOR_SECRET` is set, every request here is answered as an address that does not
 * exist, whatever it sends and however it asks. So production and staging stay shut until John sets
 * a secret on each.
