  // although almost none of them depend on each other. FB-123 took it from ~41s by bounding the
  // run-report reads; this is the rest.
  //
  // The rounds are the real dependencies and nothing more:
  //
  //   1. everything that depends on nothing — tickets, the ticket index, health, approvals, runs;
  //   2. the attention queue (needs the ticket index) and the approval histories (need the

  //   3. the filed tickets, which need the attention queue.
  //

  // burst — it is the difference between keeping that budget full and leaving it idle while one
  // request finishes.
  // Fixture sources for the UI gate + offline dev. Gated on E2E_TEST_LOGIN, not on the presence of
  // the directory alone: this is the external-action gate, and a stray env var must not be able to
  // swap a founder's real approval queue for files on disk. Keying off the same switch that already
  // enables test login means there is ONE well-known flag that turns the studio into a test rig,
