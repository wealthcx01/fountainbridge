// How Railway builds, starts and watches the studio (FB-229).
//
// This replaces railway.json, which Railway stops reading on 2026-12-01. It carries the same five
// settings, unchanged. `railway config migrate` wrote the first draft of this file and dropped two of
// them: it left the builder as a comment and lost the restart policy entirely. They are written in by
// hand below. lib/railway-config.test.ts fails if any of the five goes missing or changes.
//
// Railway does NOT read this file when it deploys. It only takes effect when someone runs
// `railway config apply` against an environment. Until that has been done for staging and production,
// railway.json is still what Railway uses, and it must not be deleted. docs/deploy.md has the steps.
//
// Running `railway config apply` is a deploy. Only John runs it: staging first, production after,
// each with a recorded approval. Nobody else applies this file, however clean the plan looks.
import { defineRailway, github, preserve, project, service } from 'railway/iac';

// The studio is the only service in this file. `partial` tells Railway to manage only what is
// declared here and leave anything else in the project alone.

export default defineRailway(() => {
  const studio = service('foundry-studio', {
    // Where the code comes from. Leave this out and `railway config apply` disconnects the
    // service from GitHub.

    // The studio's settings and keys. Keep them all here under `env`; do not also add a
    // `variables` list (Railway merges the two, and the test checks both). Every one is
    // `preserve()`: this file names them so that `apply` keeps them, and never holds a value. A
    // name missing from this list is DELETED from the environment by `apply`, which would sign
    // everyone out or stop the studio starting. So always run `railway config plan` first and stop
    // if it says anything will be destroyed.
    //
    // The list is every variable on staging and on a preview forked from production, read on
    // 2026-10-02. Staging has only the first eight of these.
