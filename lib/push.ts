/**
 * The one push (FB-141, gap G8).
 *
 * The design asks for exactly one notification and the restraint is the point:
 *
 * > A push the moment the founder becomes the blocker. **Nothing else pushes**; the queue is the
 * > only thing that waits on a person.
 *
 * ## Why the rule is a transition, not a count
 *
 * A founder with nine decisions waiting does not want nine buzzes. They want to be told once that
 * they have become the bottleneck — and a phone that buzzes nine times is a phone whose owner turns
 * notifications off, which loses the one notification that mattered. So this fires on the edge from
 * *nothing waiting* to *something waiting*, and stays silent for everything after it until the queue
 * has been cleared.
 *
 * ## Why this module has no transport in it
 *
 * Deciding what to send is a rule; sending it is plumbing with a secret attached. The rule is the
 * part that is easy to get wrong and easy to test, so it is separate and pure. See the ticket for
 * where the transport decision stands — it is not built, and nothing here pretends it is.
