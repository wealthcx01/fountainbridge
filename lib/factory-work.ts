/**
 * The factory's cards in the lists a founder already has (FB-277): the desk's "Waiting on you", the
 * Tickets screen's "Needs you", the rail's count, and "What happened".
 *
 * There is no factory page. A card is a piece of work, so it is a row in the lists that already
 * hold work. This file says, for one card and one viewer:
 *
 *   - where the card stands, from the box's state and the presses on it (`standingOf`);
 *   - whether it waits on this viewer, so it is counted in "Needs you" (`waitsOn`);
 *   - the row it is in a list (`cardRow`), and the lines it adds to "What happened" (`cardEvents`);
 *   - which pull requests read from GitHub are the same work, so a list shows one row, the card's,
 *     never two (`isSameWork`, `withoutCarded`).
 *
 * A founder reads only the card's plain parts, and those through `founderSafe` (lib/review.ts),
 * here as on the Review screen. John also gets his parts: what the run cost and what to do next.
 * Both are decided here, on the server, so a founder's browser never receives John's.
 *
 * Pure: no reads, no clock. The loader is `lib/factory-work-load.ts`.
