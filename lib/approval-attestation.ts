/**
 * Approval attestation (FB-046) — the studio side of the FB-044 gate.
 *
 * When a human approves an external action in the studio, the server signs the grant with an HMAC
 * over {repo, approval id, proposal blob sha, approver}. The gated executor
 * (deploy/executor/executor.mjs) recomputes the same HMAC with the SHARED secret and refuses anything
 * that doesn't match — so a lane (which never holds the secret) cannot forge a grant.
 *
 * **The repo is in the signed message deliberately.** One secret serves every venture, and a git blob
 * sha is content-addressed — the same proposal bytes hash identically in any repository, and the
 * approval id is just a directory name a lane chooses. Without the repo, a lane on venture B that
 * could read venture A's approvals ref could copy A's proposal.json and grant.json into its own tree
 * and have the pair verify: a real signature, for an approval no human ever issued for that venture,
 * executed with venture B's credentials. No guard can catch that — only the signed message can.
 *
 * ⚠ There are THREE implementations of this formula and they must stay byte-identical:
 * `attestationFor()` here, `verifyGrant()` in lib/provenance.ts (which calls this one — keep it that
 * way), and `expectedAttestation()` in deploy/executor/executor.mjs. The compat test in
 * lib/__tests__/approval-attestation.test.ts pins a known vector; change the format and you change
 * the executor and the vector in the same commit.
 *
 * Server-only — the secret (FOUNDRY_APPROVAL_SECRET) must never reach the client or the lane box.
