/**
 * The Review screen's model (FB-274): one finished piece of work, as the person looking at it may

 *
 * A finished card comes from the factory with parts for everyone and parts for John only: what the
 * run cost, its "What to do next" line, and the link to the run itself. A founder must never receive
 * those, so the screen is never handed the card. It is handed `reviewFor(card, viewer)`, which
 * copies the founder's parts by name and adds John's only for John. Anything the card carries that
 * is not named here reaches nobody, which is the rule the factory marks its cards by (cowgate
 * CG-0063: "anything not marked is treated as John's").
 *
 * Pure: no reads, and no clock of its own: what depends on the time is handed `now`. The loader
 * (`lib/review-load.ts`) does the reading.
