/**
 * The studio's side of a press on a factory card (FB-276).
 *
 * The studio checks who pressed and records it. It never calls Archon or GitHub for a factory card:
 * the planning box collects the press through its door and runs it through the same code as a tap
 * on Telegram (PRD, "What a press does").
 *
 * Whoever calls this has already checked the session and the venture (`requireVenture`, or
 * `authorizeVentures` and `canAccessVenture`), and that the repository is one of the venture's own.
 * In order, after that:
 *
 *   1. The card must be this venture's. The store is read scoped to this venture, so another
 *      venture's card gets exactly the answer a missing card gets.
 *   2. The press must be one this person may make. A founder may press Stop, Send back and Accept;
 *      only John has Approve, Reject, Try again and Split it. A refused press is never recorded, so
 *      the box can never collect it. It is written as one line to the studio's log instead.
 *   3. The first press wins, and the press must be on the version of the work the page showed. The
 *      store checks both and records the press in one transaction, with the card's row locked.
 *
 * In a test copy each recorded press is also written as one line to its state folder
 * (`lib/press-record.ts`), because `harness/END-TO-END.md` says so.
