/**
 * What is happening to one ticket, in one sentence (FB-098).
 *
 * John: *"the ticket get's worked (we should have some sort of simulator or loading bar for this),
 * and then a message or notification that the ticket has been worked, so the founder can review what
 * has been done."* Every piece of that loop already existed and none of it was visible AS a loop: a
 * founder filed a ticket and then met silence, and could only find out by reloading the right page
 * at the right moment and reading the activity strip like an engineer reading logs.
 *
 * ## Evidence, not animation
 *
 * The "simulator" is satisfied by truthful motion and nothing else. Every sentence below is derived
 * from something the studio actually read — a run's own timestamps, the team's real check-in, how
 * many attempts there were, whether a piece of work is open. There is deliberately no percentage and
 * no bar: a progress bar counting to nothing is the composer-said-it-filed bug (FB-062) in a costume,
 * and the whole reason this surface is trusted is that it has never yet claimed something it did not
 * know.
 *
 * The states, in the order they beat each other:
 *
 *   worked   — a piece of work is open for this ticket; the founder is the next thing that happens.
 *   parked   — it was tried and stopped. Says how many times, because "blocked" alone is not a fact
 *              anyone can act on (CLAUDE.md #10).
 *   working  — picked up, with when, and when the team last checked in.
 *   waiting  — nothing has happened yet, and that is said once per column rather than per card.
