/**
 * Everything waiting on one person, across every venture they can see (FB-149).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * An admin's header "Needs you" leads to `/attention`, the cross-venture page. That page listed
 * finished work only, and the header counted finished work only. Each venture's desk counts finished
 * work AND the sends waiting on the founder. So an admin read 4 in the header and 10 on ARCA's desk,
 * for one question.
 *
 * This loader gives the cross-venture page and the header one answer, built from the same rule every
 * venture screen uses (`lib/needs-you.ts`): for each venture, its open pull requests plus the sends
 * `sendsWaitingOnFounder` picks out. Summed per venture with `needsYouCount`, so the cross-venture
 * number is the sum of the desks' numbers and cannot drift from them.
 *
 * Split from `lib/needs-you.ts` because that file is imported by components, and this one reads the
 * network.
