/**
 * Tickets as one screen (FB-129).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A founder used to read a ticket in one place and decide about it in another — the drawer showed
 * the work, `/attention` held the lever, and nothing on either said the other existed. They had to
 * hold two screens in their head to say yes.
 *
 * This is the pure half of making them one: which tickets a filter contains, what the list says
 * about itself, and — the part that turns three navigations into one sitting — the order decisions
 * are taken in, so "Next decision →" has somewhere to point.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of rows the page already loaded. The screen is a view over the
 * board's own data, not a second read of it.
