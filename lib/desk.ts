/**
 * The desk's own sentences (FB-128).
 *
 * ## Why these are here rather than in the component
 *
 * Three surfaces state the same fact about how much waits on a founder: the summary sentence at the
 * top of the desk, the amber blocker banner under it, and the rail's "Needs you" badge on every
 * screen. Three renderings of one number is how a badge comes to say 15 while every column says 0 —
 * which is not hypothetical, it is FB-099.
 *
 * So the count is computed once, here, and the sentences are built from it. The desk imports these
 * and so does `lib/rail.ts`.
 *
 * ## What they will not say
 *
 * Anything the studio cannot see. The design's summary opens with a clause about what the venture is
 * for; no manifest carries one, so the sentence starts at the facts instead of inventing a purpose.
 * The same rule the surface outcomes follow (`docs/decision-surface-outcomes.md`): render what
 * exists, invent nothing.
