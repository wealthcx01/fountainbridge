 * FB-183: a refusal is only a refusal when the studio can prove a human made it.

 * adversarial half — what a lane could put in that file, and what must happen when it does.
 *
 * The safe direction to fail is "still waiting": the worst case is a founder asked a second time,
 * where the other direction closes a decision nobody made.
