 * No send is left unreachable (FB-183).

 * linked from somewhere a founder looks: a send still waiting is on Tickets' "Needs you" list (and
 * the desk); a send that has been decided is a row on "What happened". A send on neither is one a
 * founder can only reach by typing its address.
 *
 * Read over the UI gate's own approval fixtures — real records: proposed, granted, executed, a
 * forged grant, an executed forgery, an edited proposal — plus the one case the fixtures do not
 * hold, a send the founder refused, built the way the reader builds it.
