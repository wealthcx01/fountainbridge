// FB-229: the studio's deploy settings must survive the move from railway.json to
// .railway/railway.ts exactly. `railway config migrate` itself dropped two of the five (the builder
// and the restart policy), so this test does not trust any tool's output: it runs the real file and
// checks every value by name.
//
// The `railway` package is not installed in this repo (the Railway CLI brings its own), so the file
// is run here with small stand-ins for the five functions it imports. Each stand-in returns its
// arguments as plain data, the same shape the real ones build, so what is checked is exactly what
// the file says.
