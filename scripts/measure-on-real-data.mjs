/**
 * Measure a studio screen over a venture's REAL data, signed in as its founder (FB-178).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * CLAUDE.md #11 says the live side of every design comparison is production, signed in as the
 * venture's founder, "because fixtures are small and every fault this rule exists to catch only
 * appears at real size". For weeks that reading was recorded as blocked, on the belief that it
 * needed a signed-in session on the production server that nobody had.
 *
 * It does not. **Git is the source of truth for work items** — the studio is a view over the venture
 * repos' `docs/tickets/` through the GitHub API, with no separate database of record. So a local
 * build pointed at a real `GITHUB_TOKEN` reads exactly the data production reads. The only thing
 * production adds is its own hostname.
 *
 * The machine already had the token. `gh auth token` has had `repo` scope on `wealthcx01/arca` the
 * whole time. This script exists so that fact cannot be forgotten again.
 *
 * ## What it is not
 *
 * **Not a gate, and never run in CI.** It hits the live GitHub API, which the committed UI gate
 * deliberately never does — a gate that needs the network is a gate that fails when GitHub has a bad
 * morning. This is the manual instrument for the rule, run when a screen changes.
 *
 * It also does not decide anything. It records heights and takes pictures; a person still has to
 * look at them. Height is the cheapest proxy for "this screen shows more than it was meant to", not
 * a verdict.
 *
 * ## Running it
 *
 *     node scripts/measure-on-real-data.mjs                      # the desk, both viewports
 *     ROUTES=/venture/arca,/venture/arca/tickets node scripts/measure-on-real-data.mjs
 *     EMAIL=john.gallagher@wealthcx.com node scripts/measure-on-real-data.mjs
 *
 * It starts nothing. Build and start the studio yourself first, so the thing measured is a build you
 * chose:
 *
 *     export GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"
 *     export E2E_TEST_LOGIN=1 E2E_TEST_LOGIN_SECRET=pick-anything-local
 *     export AUTH_SECRET=pick-anything-local AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true
 *     export STUDIO_ADMIN_EMAILS=john.gallagher@wealthcx.com
 *     npm run build && npm run start -- --port 3200
 *
 * Both `E2E_TEST_LOGIN` variables are needed. With only the first, the provider is deliberately
 * inert and the hidden secret on the sign-in form renders empty — the sign-in then fails silently
 * and every screen you measure is the sign-in page. Which is why this script prints where it landed
 * beside every number.
