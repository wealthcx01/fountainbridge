 * The top of the desk (FB-128): the sentence, then the banner, then what could not be read.

 * this sequence: where things stand, what they are personally blocking, and only then what the
 * studio could not see.
 *
 * **The degraded strip is last, deliberately.** It reports a condition that clears on its own, and a
 * thing that fixes itself must never sit above a thing that does not. Putting it at the top —
 * which is where a status banner instinctively goes — would push the one item a founder is blocking
 * below a sentence telling them there is nothing to do.

/**
 * The amber banner (FB-203, item 4).
 *
 * One box, one click target, the full width of the column. Three things changed and each was a
 * sentence the design does not say:
 *
 *   - **A square, not a ⚠.** An emoji is a different typeface at a size nobody chose, and it reads
 *     as a warning about the studio rather than a fact about the founder's own queue.
 *   - **`Decide now →` is pushed right**, not buried in the middle of the sentence. It is the
 *     action, and an action inside prose is a thing people read past.
 *   - **The whole box is the target.** It was a sentence with a link in it, so most of the box did
 *     nothing when pressed — which teaches a founder that this banner is a notice rather than a way
 *     through.
 *
 * The `Needs you:` prefix is gone from the DOM text too. It was there for a screen reader and it
 * duplicated the rail's own label; the sentence already names the founder as the blocker.
 *
 * **And the clear state is drawn**, which it was not. The design gives it the same box in the quiet
 * border, so the page does not change shape when a founder finishes their queue — the one moment
 * they have earned a screen that looks settled rather than one that looks emptier.
