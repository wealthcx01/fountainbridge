/**
 * Accept and Send back: the decision on a piece of work, drawn once (FB-273).
 *
 * The same two buttons were written out three times, on the work page (`WorkDetail.tsx`), the
 * Tickets screen (`TicketsView.tsx`) and the ticket drawer (`TicketDrawer.tsx`). Each called
 * `acceptWork` and `sendBackWork` its own way, and the Review screen (FB-274) and the factory's
 * cards (FB-277) would have made five. Now every screen draws this component, and every press goes
 * through `press` below: the server action, then `noteDecision`, then a result that says which of
 * the two was pressed.
 *
 * ## Why each screen keeps its own words
 *
 * The three screens say it differently today ("Accept this work", "Make it part of my product") and
 * lay it out differently. FB-273 changed no words and no layout, so each screen picks its `look`,
 * and the look decides only the words, the test ids and where things sit. What a press does is the
 * same for all of them.
 *
 * The Review screen (FB-274) is the fourth look, `review`. It is the one look where notes go with an
 * Accept as well as a Send back, because a founder may sign off and still leave notes for their
 * team. Its notes are written on the screen's pictures, so the screen hands them in (`reviewNotes`).
 *
 * ## What a founder's Accept says
 *
 * Since FB-272 a founder's Accept is their sign-off and merges nothing. The server says so with
 * `signedOff: true`, and every look shows "signed off" rather than "accepted" when it is set.
