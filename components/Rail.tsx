          contradicting each other on every venture page in production.
          It was honest when nothing was live. FB-139 built the live office on the desk and its own

          not get deleted, and a true sentence became a false one the moment the office became real.
          The office lives on the desk. The rail already answers "is this venture's machine alive"
          once, below, from the run reports. Answering it twice from two sources is exactly what

       * The first version of this rail had one, and `e2e/composer.spec.ts` caught it: "nothing on the
       * composer sends the founder to another product". That test is FB-065's whole point — the
       * composer was moved inside the studio precisely so a founder stops being handed to a second
       * application — and a link in the persistent rail would have put that hand-off on every screen.
       *
       * The design's rail does not have one either. It was invented here, and removed. The desk keeps
       * its existing link (FB-128's business); a rail is not the place to leave the studio from.
       *
       * ## Two things item 12 asks for that are not here
       *
       * **"The pocket studio (mobile)", above Sign out.** There is nowhere honest for it to go. The
       * pocket studio is not a route — it is what the desk becomes below 48rem, and `?full=1` is the
       * toggle in the other direction. This rail is `display: none` on a phone, so the link would
       * only ever be visible on a desktop, where pressing it does nothing. FB-138 built the screen;
       * it did not build a place to send somebody from a desktop. A nav row that cannot work where it
       * is shown is a dead control, which the design contract forbids.
       *
       * **The office thumbnail, with "3 at work · 3 waiting on you".** The "waiting on you" half is
       * already three rows above this, on the Needs you badge — and FB-167 deleted an office block
       * from this exact spot because it was a second statement about the same machine, one screen
       * apart from the first, and the two disagreed in production. The "at work" half is not free:
       * it needs one run report per surface, and reading those in the rail is precisely what FB-164
       * removed when every screen under a venture was waiting about six seconds for it — including a
       * handbook page whose own content arrives in 279ms. Half a sentence that duplicates the badge,
       * bought with six seconds on every page, is a bad trade. It is written down in the ticket with
       * what it would take: the box publishing a per-surface summary the rail can read in one file.
