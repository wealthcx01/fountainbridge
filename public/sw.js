/*
 * The studio's service worker (FB-141).
 *
 * ## It caches almost nothing, and that is the design
 *
 * A service worker that caches responses would be the single most dangerous file in this repository.
 * Every interesting page here is venture-scoped and session-scoped: `/venture/<id>` is one founder's
 * desk, decided server-side per request (CLAUDE.md #6). A cache sitting in front of that can serve
 * one founder's venture to the next person to open the app on a shared device, and can serve a
 * decision queue that was emptied an hour ago.
 *
 * So the rule is absolute and it is expressed as an allow-list, not a deny-list: only files that are
 * the same for everybody are ever cached. A deny-list would need updating every time a route is
 * added, and the failure mode of forgetting is a founder seeing another founder's work.
 *
 * ## Why it exists at all
 *
 * Installability. iOS will not add a site to the home screen as an app, and will not accept a push
 * subscription, without a registered service worker. Its only other job is to show the one push
 * (at the bottom of this file) — and it caches nothing for that either.
