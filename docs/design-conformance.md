# The studio, measured against its design

**Taken 2026-09-02**, against `main` at `64f3eaa`, on production
(`foundry-studio-production-4a73.up.railway.app`) signed in as ARCA's founder.

Both sides were rendered in a real browser and looked at — the design prototype was clicked through
screen by screen, not read as markup. This is the scorecard CLAUDE.md rule 11 asks every screen
change to add a line to.

## How to take it again

Sign in to production as the venture's founder, and for each route record
`document.documentElement.scrollHeight` and
`scrollWidth - clientWidth` at **1440×1000** and on an **iPhone 13** profile. Open the design
artifact in the same browser and click through to the matching screen. Then *look at both.*

Height is not the point — it is the cheapest visible proxy for "this screen shows more than it was
designed to". Every gap below was found by the number and then confirmed by reading the picture.

## The scorecard

| screen | design | desktop | phone | verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sign in | one screen | — | — | **not compared** |
| The desk | ~1,900px | 3,830px | 4,221px | gap: the approval cards (FB-183) |
| Tickets | 1,090px | **1,471px** | **1,470px** | **fixed, FB-185** (was 6,864 / 8,008) |
| a ticket | — | **1,508px** | **1,945px** | **fixed, FB-185** (was 6,864 / 8,859) |
| What happened | ~1,000px | **1,487px** | **2,910px** | **fixed, FB-180** (was 3,556 / 6,536) |
| Memory | ~1,000px | 1,570px | — | FB-181 |
| Composer | ~1,000px | 1,096px | 990px | **matches** |
| Handbook | 1,000px | 1,096px | 1,782px | matches on desktop; phone unexplained |
| a chapter | ~1,000px | 1,188px | 899px | **matches** |
| The pocket studio | ~600px | — | 4,221px | FB-160 |

No screen scrolls sideways at either size. That was not true two weeks ago (FB-153, FB-124).

## What the numbers turned out to mean

**Tickets was the worst screen, at six to eight times its design. FB-185 fixed it** — 6,864px to
1,471px on desktop, 8,008px to 1,470px on a phone.

The ticket predicted one cause and there were two.

The predicted one was right and was the larger: the screen opened on **All**, which is every ticket
the venture ever had — 80 on ARCA, 37 of them finished — against a design that opens on **Needs you**
(`filter: 'needs'` in the wireframe's own state, twice). That is one line, and it took desktop from
7,123px to 2,967px.

The second was not in the ticket. The detail pane **rendered the whole ticket file**, at the global
heading sizes, in a column beside the list: `Context`, `Scope`, `Out of scope`, `Acceptance
criteria`, research bullets carrying full URLs. ARCA-068 is 1,730px of that on its own, sitting
directly above the box where a founder approves the work. The design's ticket detail is the opening
of the ticket and then the decision — it shows no scope list anywhere. So the opening is shown and
the rest is one press away behind **Read the whole ticket**, and nothing is removed.

A third thing the height could not have found, and the picture did: on a phone the two columns
stacked, so the screen showed the whole queue *and* the full text of whichever ticket it had selected
by default underneath it. Opening a ticket then meant scrolling past all eighty to reach it. The
design's phone treatment is one column at a time, and it is now one column at a time.

**How the after numbers were taken.** The before numbers are production. The after numbers are a
local production build running on production's own configuration and reading the same live GitHub
data — ARCA's real 80 tickets — because the change is not deployed until it merges. Same data, same
build, different host. Re-confirm on production once it has deployed.

**The pocket studio shows two sections the design does not have on a phone.** The design's own
description is exact: *"The same events, one column: the blocker banner, the live office, the queue,
the prompt."* Four things, about 600px. Ours has those four (85 + 568 + 668 + 112 = 1,433px, already
more than twice the design's) and then adds `lane-activity` (305px) and `dept-surfaces` (1,031px),
neither of which the design puts on a phone at all.

**Three screens match and should be left alone**: the Composer, a Handbook chapter, and the Handbook
on desktop. The Composer matching matters — it is the screen with the most behaviour on it.

**"What happened" was a commit log and is now an account. FB-180** took it from 3,556px to 1,487px
on desktop and 6,536px to 2,910px on a phone, and the height was the smallest part of it. All six
faults the audit named are gone: twenty identical rows are one row with a count, slugs read as
`ARCA-061, saved card lists not persisting`, commit prefixes and pull request numbers are stripped,
a push and its pull request are one row, dates are `Today 00:57 / Yesterday / 27 August` with the
calendar date still on the row for anyone who needs it, and the meta column names `Build — Product`
rather than `arca`.

Two things came out of reading it that the ticket had not named. The meta column was saying the
meaning as well as the surface — `Build — Product · shipped` — which the sentence beside it already
said, and the width that cost wrapped eleven of twenty rows onto a second line. And the summary's
`Most recently: A, B and C` names the three items that are the first three rows directly beneath it.

**Handbook is 1,782px on a phone against 1,096px on desktop.** A page of prose should get *shorter*
in a narrower column only if the type scales; growing by 62% suggests something is not reflowing.
Unexplained, and worth ten minutes.

**Sign in was never compared.** It is the one screen a founder sees before they trust anything, and
it is not in this table because I did not do it.

## What this scorecard cannot tell you

Height finds a screen showing too much. It cannot find a screen showing the *wrong* thing at the
right length, wrong copy, wrong order, or a control that does not work. Every one of those has been
found here by reading the picture, and three of them — the desk's finished-ticket board, "What
happened" printing one sentence twenty times, and Memory listing README files as founder knowledge —
passed every automated gate in the repository.
